# ToDo
A website where you can create and track entries detailing tasks and homework to be completed. 
Used Flask to access HTML form data and SQLite to perform sorted queries and insertions.
Future updates may include restrictions on entries based on dates (forbidding entries with due dates in the past)
and integrating the homework and task lists together in the home page.

Project was tested and run using "flask run" command

Project started December 22, 2022 and completed January 26, 2023
