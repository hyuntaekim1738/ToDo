# ToDo
A website where you can create and track entries detailing tasks and homework to be completed. 
Used Flask to access HTML form data and SQLite to perform sorted queries and insertions. Future updates may
include restrictions on entries based on dates (forbidding entries with due dates in the past)
and integrating the homework and task lists together in the home page.

Project was tested and run using "flask run" command

Project started December 22, 2022 and completed January 26, 2023

Created to apply info from an online basic web development course.

In future projects, I will create more thorough documentation of my code, labelling functions with comments
and organizing the code to be more understandable. Much time was lost to rereading code when beginning
programming sessions to remember what each line served to do.
